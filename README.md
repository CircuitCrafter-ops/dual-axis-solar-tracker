## üöÄ How to Run the Simulation
To get started with the Solar Tracker Controller Project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-tracker.git
   ```
 Open the project in MATLAB/Simulink and follow the instructions in this README for usage.
  Note that the model relies on the parameters defined in the `WormAndGearConstraintParameters` file. Before running the model, ensure that you load these parameters.
## Usage and Steps to Run the Simulation


1. **Run** `Solar_calculations.mlx` to initialize location and time settings.
2. **Open** `Solar_Tracker_Model_Dual_axis.slx` in Simulink and simulate.
3. **Run** `Irradiance.mlx` to calculate panel exposure.
4. **Open** `Comparison_and_analysis.slx` to view and analyze results.

## üñº## Simulation Results

The following simulation results are based on the geographical location of Roorkee, India, with coordinates at a latitude of 29.8543¬∞ N and a longitude of 77.8880¬∞ E, on March 23, 2024.

### Variation of Azimuth and Elevation Angles
The graph below illustrates the variation of azimuth and elevation angles throughout the day for the specified location and date.

### Solar Tracker Operation
- **Daytime Tracking:** The GIF below depicts the solar tracker following the sun during the day in Roorkee, India, on March 23, 2024. The simulation starts at midnight and shows how the tracker adjusts the panel angles to maximize sunlight exposure.

- **Comparative Analysis:** The following graph shows the irradiance generated by Fixed solar panel and the Proposed Dual axis solar tracker. This panel is oriented south with a tilt angle of 15¬∞, optimized for summer by adjusting the tilt to capture maximum sunlight. The graph compares the performance of these two systems for the same location and date.
